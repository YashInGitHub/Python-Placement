Cheat Sheet for Time Complexity
- When your calculation is not dependent on the input size, it is constant time complexity (O(1)) 
- When the input siez is reduced to half, maybe when iterating, handling recursion, its Logarithmic time complexity (O(logn))
- When you have a single loop within your algorithm, it is linear complexity (O(n))
- When you have nested loops within your algorithm, its quadratic time complexity O(n^2)
- When the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input, it is exponential time complexity (O(2^n))
