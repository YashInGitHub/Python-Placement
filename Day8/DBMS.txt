=> SQL - Structured Query Language

Types of SQL languages:
-> DDL: Data Definition Language
Defines the structure of a table
    CREATE - Used to create new table in the database
    CREATE TABLE <TABLE_NAME>;

    DROP - Delete both structure and the record present in the table
    DROP DATABASE <DB_NAME>;
    DROP TABLE <TABLE_NAME>;

    ALTER - Alters the structure of the database like the attributes or to add a new attribute
    ALTER TABLE <TABLE_NAME> ADD <COLUMN_NAME (COLUMN_DEFINITION)>; //This is to add a new attribute
    ALTER TABLE <TABLE_NAME> MODIFY(COLUMN_DEFINITION); //This is to modify the attribute

    TRUNCATE - Deletes all the rows from the table and frees the space from the table
    TRUNCATE TABLE <TABLE_NAME>

->DML: Data Manipulation Language
These are used to modify the database
They don't make the changes permanent i.e. they are not auto commited and hence can be rolled-back

    INSERT - Used to insert data into the row of a table
    INSERT INTO <TABLE_NAME> VALUES(<COL1, COL2, COL3, ...., COLN>)

    UPDATE - Used to modify the contents in the table
    UPDATE <TABLE_NAME>
    SET [COL_NAME = VAL1, .... ]
    WHERE <CONDITION>

    DELETE - Used to remove 1 or more row from a table
    DELETE FROM <TABLE_NAME>
    WHERE <CONDITION>

->DCL: Data Control Language 
These are used to grant and revoke authority from a user to the database

    GRANT: Used to give user access privilage to a database
    GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON <TABLE_NAME> TO <USERNAME1>, <USERNAME2>,...;

    REVOKE: Used to take back permission from the user
    REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON <TABLE_NAME> FROM <USERNAME1>, <USERNAME2>,...;

->TCL: Transaction Control Language
Can be only used with DML Commands i.e. INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE

    COMMIT: Used to save all transactions to the database
    COMMIT;

    ROLLBACK: To undo the transactions that has not already been saved
    ROLLBACK;

    SAVEPOINT: Used to roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction
    SAVEPOINT <SAVEPOINT_NAME>

->DQL: Data Query Language
Fetches the data from the database

    SELECT: Selects and attribute based on the conditon in the where clause
    SELECT <ATTRIBUTE_NAMES>
    FROM <TABLE_NAME>
    WHERE <CONDITION>
